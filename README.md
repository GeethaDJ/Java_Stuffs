This is the README.md file. I clone the hello-world repository using git clone command
git clone command created a file hello-world (repository name created in github in my github account)
Then i listed files in it . As i have done nothing it just included README.md file only. 
Then i wrote message till now.# hello-world
This is the second time i try to learn github
